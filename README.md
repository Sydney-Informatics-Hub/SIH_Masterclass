Presented by Dr. Giorgia Mori of the Sydney Informatics Hub.

Data visualization is more than just making plots. It is a powerful way to showcase astounding results, communicate information, tell stories, and influence decisions. But how can we design impactful visuals that are clear, compelling, and captivating? 

In this Masterclass, we will showcase the principles of and best practices for data visualization design. We will explore how to choose the right visualisation type with a goal in mind and how to tailor images for a specific audience. We'll talk about how colour, shape, size, layout and interactivity can make our plots, infographics and charts stand out. 

Whether you're writing your Honours thesis, crafting your first paper or a seasoned researcher with an H-Index greater than 60, this workshop is for you (and just to be clear: this one has no coding involved)! 

The Sydney Informatics Hub is a Core Research Facility at The University of Sydney, enabling excellence in research.
